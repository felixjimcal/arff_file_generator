# arff_file_generator
Generates an ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) with multiple indicators for a market, crypto, symbol.

The main goal is to create an ARFF file with data from Binance exchange about a symbol (DOGE_USDT).
This first approach will ask no questions to the user and generates the file only.
Eventually new features like symbol selection and timeframes will we added.
